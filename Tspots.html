            Baltistan province. It is a secluded valley, sitting between the

          <p>
            Swat is located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Due
            to its scenic beauty, pleasant weather, and hospitable people, it is
            very much a piece of heaven on earth, just like Hunza. Swat Valley
            is famous not only for its breathtaking landscape but also for its
            natural wildlife. It has luscious forests, high peak mountains, and
            beautiful lakes.

          <img src="naran-kaghan.jpg" alt="Taj Mahal" />
          <p>
            Naran and Kaghan are incredible tourist locations located in the
            Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. These valleys are the perfect spot for
            nature lovers. They offer flowing rivers, miles of meadows, snowy
            mountains, and breathtaking lakes. The valleys are some of the most
            visited tourist spots in the country. This region is abundant in
            natural beauty. It is defined by the crystal waters of the rivers,
            the green grass of the meadows, and the snow-capped peaks of the
            mountains.

          <h2>Kalash Valley</h2>
          <img src="kalash.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Chitral is a small cozy town nesting beneath the mighty Hindu Kush
            mountains. It is inhabited by a tough, warm, and hospitable
            community. Within a two-hour drive from Chitral, you will reach
            Kalash, a UNESCO heritage site with a thousand-year-old culture. The
            Kalasha are approximately five thousand people, who, to this day,
            still live as they did many centuries ago. Every year tourists visit
            to witness and be enlightened by their traditions and culture. The
            women dress in traditional garb with a small cap, and the garb is
            black with colorful embroidery, made by the uniquely talented women
            of Kalash. Men and women come together and dance at every festival.

          <h2>Bahawalpur</h2>
          <img src="bwp.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Bahawalpur is an old city located in Punjab. It lies between the
            arid landscapes of the Cholistan desert, close to the border,
            neighboring India. It was once a princely state, part of the
            Rajputana States that stretched across Rajasthan in India, and was
            ruled by Nawabs and Nizams. The city is filled with historic
            monuments and old architecture, like the Noor Mehal. The city is a
            snapshot in time, taking you back to the era of the ancient kings
            who used to rule over this region.
